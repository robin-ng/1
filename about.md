I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE), Universit√© catholique de Louvain.\
My research interest are industrial organization, behavioral economics, microeconomic theory.\
Most of my research focuses on issues of the digital economy, particularly on the formation, provision and manipulation of online ratings. 

My wonderful supervisors are Paul Belleflamme and Johannes Johnen. 

I am a part of the "Platform Regulation and Operations in the Sharing Economy" research team and am affiliated with ROSELS.\
I currently organise the CORE brown bag and IO reading group. Do email me if you wish to present at the CORE Brown Bag.
