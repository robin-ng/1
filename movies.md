**2004**	\

I also have an unhealthy love for movies that revolve around phones.\
This started with the movie Phone Booth (2002). \
While I do enjoy these movies tremendously, I may not generally recommend them.

Cellular (2004) 	\
When a Stranger Calls (2006)	\
The Caller (2011)	\
The Guilty (2021)	\
The Black Phone (2021)	\
