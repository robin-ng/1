Ramen criteria: \
To me, the most important aspect of ramen is the broth.
It is rather off-putting if the broth and ajitama fails a quick visual inspection.
Next is the noodles, unfortunately most places don't make their own. Even so, shockingly, there are ways to mess up packaged noodles. Then we have the dressing/ingredients which should be simple and complement the broth. Finally, tender meat.
