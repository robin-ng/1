**Ratings and Reciprocity** with [Johannes Johnen](https://sites.google.com/site/johannesjohneneconomist/home) \
Abstract:\
Evidence suggests online ratings and reviews are intrinsically motivated, and reviewers reciprocate offers of sufficient value-for-money with good ratings. Incorporating reciprocity into a model of ratings, we explore how firms use prices to impact their own ratings. We show that firms harvest ratings: they offer lower prices in early periods to trigger consumers' reciprocal behaviour and obtain a good rating and larger profits in the future. Because also low-quality firms harvest ratings, reciprocity makes ratings less informative. Based on this mechanism, (i) we argue that reciprocity-based ratings cause rating inflation; (ii) we show that a marketplace that facilitates ratings (e.g. through reminders, one-click ratings etc) may get more ratings, but also less informative ratings; (iii) a marketplace that screens the quality of sellers (e.g. a minimum average rating or quality controls) makes ratings less informative if the screening is insufficient. We also explore the impact of reciprocity-based ratings on surplus. We show that even as ratings become less informative, consumers can benefit from lower prices. Nonetheless consumers prefer more informative ratings than average sellers. We apply these results to characterise when a two-sided platform wants to facilitate ratings, and thereby undermines the informativeness of ratings and harms consumers. We connect our results evidence and a wide range of applications and provide robustness checks.
