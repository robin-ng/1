**Ratings and Reciprocity** with [Johannes Johnen](https://sites.google.com/site/johannesjohneneconomist/home) \
Abstract:\
Recent evidence suggests online ratings and reviews are intrinsically motivated and reviewers reciprocate offers of sufficient value-for-money with good ratings. We incorporate reciprocity into a model of ratings, where consumers rate positively if they receive a high value-for-money and perceive firms to be sufficiently kind. Our key mechanism is that to benefit from reciprocity, firms offer lower prices in exchange for good ratings, increasing future prices and profits. Firms reinforce this mechanism and are more likely to induce good ratings when i) consumers exhibit a stronger sense of reciprocity or when ii) it is easier for consumers to leave ratings. This way, the presence of reciprocity can explain the documented phenomenon of ratings inflation, and less informative ratings, especially as it becomes easier to leave ratings. We discuss how further marketplace features affect the reciprocity mechanism and the informativeness of ratings: First, a two-sided platform might indeed choose to make it easier for consumers to rate, thereby undermining the informativeness of ratings. Second, many platforms screen the quality of sellers and kick out low-quality sellers. We characterize when such quality screening reduces or reinforces the informativeness of ratings. Third, competition between sellers leads to lower informativeness of ratings. Finally, we show that more-informative ratings do not necessarily translate to larger consumer surplus.


**Ratings with Heterogeneous Preferences** with [Jonathan Lafky](https://sites.google.com/site/jonathanlafky/home) \
Abstract:\
We ask how ratings are interpreted in the presence of heterogeneous preferences among both raters and consumers. We consider a ratings environment in which ratings are provided for products with two dimensions of quality, and both consumers and raters have heterogeneous preferences over each of the dimensions. Under the assumption that raters are altruistic, raters should attempt to maximize the expected utility of consumers. However, an ambiguity arises in the presence of heterogenous preferences, in that multiple equilibria exist, one in which ratings serve as an expression of the rater's own payoffs, and one in which ratings are instead an expression of the expected payoff to consumers. We show how ratings change when raters are aware of their unusual preferences. We also study the role that common knowledge – information about who left a rating, or verifiable product qualities – plays in affecting the equilibrium ratings.
