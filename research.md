**Ratings and Reciprocity** with [Johannes Johnen](https://sites.google.com/site/johannesjohneneconomist/home) \
Abstract:\
Recent evidence suggests online ratings and reviews are intrinsically motivated, and reviewers reciprocate offers of sufficient value-for-money with good ratings. We incorporate reciprocity into a model of ratings: if firms offer a sufficiently high value for money, consumers perceive them as kind and rate them positively. To benefit from the reciprocal behavior of consumers, firms offer lower prices in exchange for a good rating. This allows firms to set higher prices in the future. Firms reinforce this mechanism and are more likely to induce good ratings when i) consumers exhibit a stronger sense of reciprocity or when ii) it is easier for consumers to leave ratings. We show that low-quality firms obtaining good ratings leads to less informative ratings. This way, reciprocity-motivated ratings provide a novel explanation for ratings inflation, the phenomenon where ratings are becoming less informative about product quality. However, less informative ratings may not harm consumers, as they benefit from lower prices. We discuss how common marketplace features affect reciprocity-motivated ratings and the informativeness of ratings. First, a two-sided platform might indeed choose to make it easier for consumers to rate, thereby undermining the informativeness of ratings. Second, many platforms screen sellers for quality, removing lower quality sellers. We characterize when such screening reduces or reinforces the informativeness of ratings. Third, competition between sellers leads to lower informativeness of ratings. Our results are robust to the ratings scale, time horizon, and distribution of firm quality.
